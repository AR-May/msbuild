# Async Tasks

## Overview
We should consider how MSBuild can benefit from asynchronous task execution patterns that align with modern .NET development practices.

## Interface Definition

```csharp
public interface IAsyncTask : ITask
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Executes the task asynchronously with the provided execution context.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="cancellationToken">Token to cancel the task execution</param>
    /// <returns>A task that represents the asynchronous execution. True if successful, false otherwise.</returns>
    Task<bool> ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default) { }
}
```

## Questions and Design Notes

**Question**: Should async tasks implement both `Execute()` and `ExecuteAsync()`, or should we separate async interfaces from sync interfaces?

**Question**: Do we need a default implementation of `ExecuteAsync()` that calls `Execute()`? This would be false async - creating overhead without benefits. We probably should not encourage this pattern.

**Question**: Async design provides proper support for cancellation during long-running operations. We already have `ICancelableTask` that allows canceling tasks that implement it, but having proper cancellation support is beneficial. How will cancellation through the `cancellationToken` interact with existing cancellation via `ICancelableTask`?

**Question**: Will our exception handling and error reporting be affected by the change to async?

**Question**: We still have a limited number of thread nodes, each running tasks sequentially. How do async patterns combine with this architecture? What will the node do when awaiting I/O? Threads that execute the task would not be blocked during I/O operations, but the node threads themselves would be, so we would not save any resources.

**Question**: What overhead will we pay for making MSBuild and SDK tasks async? Will the benefits outweigh the costs?
